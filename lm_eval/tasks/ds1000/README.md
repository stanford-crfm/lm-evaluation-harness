Title: DS-1000: A Natural and Reliable Benchmark for Data Science Code Generation

Abstract: https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11501

DS-1000 is a benchmark for evaluating data science code generation, covering popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Matplotlib, SciPy, and Scikit-learn. It contains 1000 problems derived from StackOverflow questions.

* `ds1000`: Data science code completion problems with execution-based evaluation

### Checklist

For adding novel benchmarks/datasets to the library:

* [x] Is the task an existing benchmark in the literature?
  * [x] Have you referenced the original paper that introduced the task?
  * [ ] If yes, does the original paper provide a reference implementation? If so, have you checked against the reference implementation and documented how to run such a test?

If other tasks on this dataset are already supported:

* [x] Is the "Main" variant of this task clearly denoted?
* [x] Have you provided a short sentence in a README on what each new variant adds / evaluates?
* [ ] Have you noted which, if any, published evaluation setups are matched by this variant?
