# DeepMind Mathematics Dataset

Evaluation tasks based on the DeepMind Mathematics Dataset.

## Dataset

The data is hosted on HuggingFace: [WillHeld/deepmind-math](https://huggingface.co/datasets/WillHeld/deepmind-math)

This dataset contains 5,600 examples (100 per category) across 56 math categories. This is a sample used by OLMo for evaluation.
